# ðŸš€ My Web App

This project was created as I started to think of our "next great idea" for a cloud service app. I wantd to get all of the common tasks done that are needed for any web application. Things like basic structure, login, security, sign-up, user management, etc. The work is progressing slow but steady and we are in a good place to start showing some value and seeing if others are wiling to contribute.

# Basic architecture

There are 3 main components to the application so far.

- My Web App
- Identity Service
- Admin Service

### My Web App

This is built using the [Webbee - Multipurpose Template + UI Kit](https://webbee.maccarianagency.com/). The template is built in React and is based on Material-UI design. It is mix of JavaScript and TypeScript files. It is the front end of the service and communicates via REST endpoints back to the microservices.

### Identity Service

The Identity Service is a set of REST API's and SQL database that manages all the login, authorization, and sign-up workflows. This repo is currently private.

### Admin Service

The Admin Service is also a set of REST API's that sit on top of the Identity Service database. It currently handles admin specific tasks like users, sessions, and code management.

For all course management admin tasks
