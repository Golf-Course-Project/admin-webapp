# 🧑‍💻 Admin App

This is a react project and is used to manage all of the admin tasks for The Golf Course Project. There are lot of things not completed yet, doing the minimum to get the application to go live. 

# 🏗️ Basic architecture

This app connects to several micro services:

- Identity Service
- Admin Service
- User Service
- Course Service

### Details

This is built using the [Webbee - Multipurpose Template + UI Kit](https://webbee.maccarianagency.com/). The template is built in React and is based on Material-UI design. It is mix of JavaScript and TypeScript files. It is the front end of the service and communicates via REST endpoints back to the microservices.
