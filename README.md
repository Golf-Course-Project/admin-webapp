# ðŸš€ My Web App

This project was created as I started to think of our "next great idea" for a cloud service app. I wantd to get all of the common tasks done that are needed for any web application. Things like basic structure, login, security, sign-up, user management, etc. The work is progressing slow but steady and we are in a good place to start showing some value and seeing if others are wiling to contribute.

# Basic architecture

There are 3 main components to the application so far.

- My Web App
- Identity Service
- Admin Service

### My Web App

This is built using the [Webbee - Multipurpose Template + UI Kit](https://webbee.maccarianagency.com/). The template is built in React and is based on Material-UI design. It is mix of JavaScript and TypeScript files. It is the front end of the service and communicates via REST endpoints back to the microservices.

### Identity Service

The Identity Service is a set of REST API's and SQL database that manages all the login, authorization, and sign-up workflows. This repo is currently private.

### Admin Service

The Admin Service is also a set of REST API's that sit on top of the Identity Service database. It currently handles admin specific tasks like users, sessions, and code management.
