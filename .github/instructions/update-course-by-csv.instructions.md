Go thru the csv one row at a time. Start with row 125. If there is a courseId value, then fetch the course. Check to see if the Designer and YearOpened field have a value. If the value in the fetch is different than the csv, take the values from the csv and update the course. Only update Designer and YearOpened field. Do not update any other fields. Only udate if the values are missing from the fetch or different from the csv.

I don't need you to create any powershell scripts. Just go thru the csv one row at a time.

Go row by row. Complete the entire csv file. Do not ask for confirmation to keep going. Just do them all.
